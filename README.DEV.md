## 🚀 Getting Started

Getting Started with Astro<br>===============================

Astro is a fast, scalable web framework for building modern web applications. It's designed to be easy to use and provides a powerful set of features for building high-performance web applications. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of getting started with Astro.

## Installing Astro

To get started with Astro, you'll need to install it using npm or yarn. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g astro
```

Once Astro is installed, you can create a new project by running the following command:

```
astro init my-project
```

This will create a new directory called `my-project` with the basic structure for an Astro project.

## Running Astro

To run your Astro project, you can use the `astro dev` command in your terminal. This will start a development server that you can use to preview your application.

You can also use the `astro build` command to build your application for production. This will create a static site that you can deploy to a hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.

## Using Astro Components

Astro components are the building blocks of your application. They provide a way to organize your code and make
